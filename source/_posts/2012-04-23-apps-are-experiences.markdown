I was inspired by Matt Gemmell's post once again: "[Augemented-Paper](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/04/13/augmented-paper/)":
{% blockquote [Matt Gemmel] [http://mattgemmell.com/2012/04/13/augmented-paper/] [Augmented Paper] %}
software experiences that feel like Augmented Paper are those that second-guess our (developersâ€™) natural tendency to put functionality first, or to think of our apps as software. Apps are only incidentally software; software is an implementation detail. Instead, apps are experiences.
{% endblockquote %}

Can't agree more.
